# Weather app

This source contains a simple and basic weather app using a public weather APIs.  
Since it does not having http respond from the API so website is not accessible.
## Demo of our app

Mainly, User can able to access there location's weather just by entering the **City name**.  

And user get information about **Temperature, Humidity and wind speed** also.  
This project purely based on **HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript**.
